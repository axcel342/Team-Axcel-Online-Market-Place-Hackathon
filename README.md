# Team-Axcel-Online-Market-Place-Hackathon
This projects contains implementation of an online market place with key concepts of block chain used; a public ledger, trading bitcoins, wallets and Miner's proof of work/mining competition. 

## Note:
*The sole language used is C++. It is advised to use a relevant IDE such as Visual Studio.
*Source.cpp contains the main code to execute the application, user.txt, product.txt and Blockchain.txt contain information needed for file handling.

## Description:

## What it does
This program shows an the implementation of Block chain concepts such as Trading in bitcoins, storing them in The blockchain, Mining Competition and the proof of work used. 

## How we built it
We coded in C++ solely and implemented the public ledger ( Blockchain ) through file handling adding each transaction with the reference code of the previous transaction as a result diminishing the possibility of overspending. IN addition we showed how miners compete by using the rand functions to represent miners and the hash they were competing to solve. Lastly, we also showed trading in bitcoins, storing them in wallets, creating profiles for different users and the overall interactions taking place inside an online marketplace.
